### Adaptive Overload Control for Busy Internet Servers 
#### Internally monitoring the performance of the service, which is decomposed into a set of event-driven stages connected with request queues. By controlling the rate at which each stage admits requests, the service can perform focused overload management, for example, by filtering only those requests that lead to resource bottlenecks.

### Taiji: managing global user traffic for large-scale internet services at the edge
#### Policy, assigning traffic objects at the edge to the data centers to satisfy service-level objectives. Taiji uses a constraint optimization solver to generate an optimal routing table that specifies the fractions of traffic each edge node will distribute to different data centers.

### Overload Control for Scaling WeChat Microservices
#### It manages overload at the microservice granule such that each microservice monitors its load status in real time and triggers load shedding in a collaborative manner among its relevant services when overload is detected.
