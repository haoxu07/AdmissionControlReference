## 1. Adaptive Overload Control for Busy Internet Servers 
#### Internally monitoring the performance of the service, which is decomposed into a set of event-driven stages connected with request queues. By controlling the rate at which each stage admits requests, the service can perform focused overload management, for example, by filtering only those requests that lead to resource bottlenecks.

## 4.Admission control of API requests in OpenStack
#### We confirmed that admission control could improve the performance of OpenStack services by more than 50% in an overloaded situation. We also proposed a heuristic algorithm that adaptively tuned the concurrent connection limit by monitoring the statistics of the completed API requests obtained from a proxy server. Our experimental evaluation revealed that our algorithm helped avoid severe performance degradation in OpenStack.

## 6.Maelstrom: Mitigating Datacenter-level Disasters by Draining Interdependent Traffic Safely and Efficiently
#### Maelstrom provides a traffic management framework with modular, reusable primitives that can be composed to safely and efficiently drain the traffic of interdependent services from one or more failing datacenters to the healthy ones. Maelstrom ensures safety by encoding inter-service dependencies and resource constraints. Maelstrom uses health monitoring to implement feedback control so that all specified constraints are satisfied by the traffic drains and recovery procedures executed during disaster mitigation. Maelstrom exploits parallelism to drain and restore independent traffic sources efficiently.

## 9. An Admission Control Scheme for Predictable Server Response Time for Web Accesses
#### provide different levels of services based on the server workload characteristics. Service quality is ensured by periodical allocation of system resources based on the estimation of request rate and service requirements of prioritized tasks. Admission of lower priority tasks is restricted during high load periods to prevent denial-of-services to high priority tasks. A doublequeue structure is implemented to reduce the eects of estimation inaccuracy and to utilize the spare capacity of the server, thus increasing the system throughput. Response delays of the high priority tasks are bounded by the length of the prediction period.

## 10. QoS-Aware Admission Control and Resource Allocation in Underlay Device-to-Device Spectrum-Sharing Networks
#### we introduce an objective that combines the access rate and the network sum rate and then maximize it subject to usersâ€™ quality-of-service requirements and resource allocation constraints. Due to its mixed combination, we focus on designing cost-efficient and easyto-implement algorithms instead of finding globally optimal but exponentially complex solutions. By decomposition, we first devise two novel mode selection criteria and an admission-prioritized partner assignment scheme and obtain closed-form solutions for both admission control and power allocation.

## 11. FACS-MP: A fuzzy admission control system with many priorities for wireless cellular networks and its performance evaluation
#### considering the priority of the on-going connections. We called this system FACS-P. In FACS-P, as priority parameter, we considered only one parameter (service request). We extended our work by adding different priorities. We call this system FACS-MP. In this paper, we evaluate by simulations the performance of the proposed system. From the simulation results, we conclude that the FACS-MP makes a good differentiation of different services and has better behaviour than FACS-P.

## 15. Q-Cop: Avoiding bad query mixes to minimize client timeouts under heavy loads
#### we show that the response times of different types of queries can vary significantly depending not just on the number of queries being processed but on the mix of other queries that are running simultaneously. We develop a model of expected query execution times that accounts for the mix of queries being executed and integrate this model into a three-tiered system to make admission control decisions. Our results show that this approach makes more informed decisions about which queries to reject and as a result significantly reduces the number of requests that time out.
